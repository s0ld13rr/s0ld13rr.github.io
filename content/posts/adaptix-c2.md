## Introduction

![AdaptixC2 Practical OPSEC](/adaptix-practical-opsec.png)

In red team operations, operational security (OPSEC) is often the only thing standing between a successful engagement and total exposure. Misconfigured C2 profiles, default ports, and unmodified headers are enough for defenders to fingerprint and block entire infrastructures within minutes.

This article focuses on practical OPSEC hardening for AdaptixC2 — small, concrete steps that drastically reduce detection surface. You won’t find theory here, only actionable configurations and common-sense modifications proven in real environments. I chose AdaptixC2 because it’s open-source, highly customizable, and steadily gaining popularity within the cybersecurity community. Its flexibility makes it a solid platform for both research and red team operations. Also, user inferface and workflow looks like a CobaltStrike & Havoc.

By following this checklist, your teamserver will blend in better, resist fingerprinting, and maintain persistence longer during operations.

## Why OPSEC matters for Red Teamers

Operational security (OPSEC) isn’t just about keeping your own tools safe — it’s about ensuring your tests are realistic, repeatable, and (critically) legally and ethically bounded. 

Good OPSEC reduces accidental exposure of infrastructure, prevents easy attribution to your organization, avoids contaminating customer environments, and helps defenders improve detection without being misled by avoidable mistakes.

When using a C2 framework such as Adaptix in assessments, small defaults are often the easiest signals for defenders and automated detection systems to pick up. Hardening those defaults and following best practices helps your engagement emulate a realistic adversary while keeping the exercise controlled.

## How Defenders Hunt for C2?


We can use this query in Censys.io to hunt for those indicators:

## Checklist

1. Change the C2 default port to a high port (`49152–65535`)
    
2. Set a strong password for the teamserver (≥16 chars, random)
    
3. Rename the server in `profile.json` to a neutral / generated hostname
    
4. Replace the default 404 page (remove recognizable signature)
    
5. Change the default `/endpoint` in the C2 profile (avoid standard paths)
    
6. Remove the `Adaptix Version` HTTP header from `profile.json`
    
7. For HTTP listener: change Heartbeat header and User-Agent
    
8. Generate and install SSL certificates for the HTTP listener (TLS required)
    
9. Add proper, neutral HTTP headers when generating the agent (e.g., neutral Server, Cache-Control, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
