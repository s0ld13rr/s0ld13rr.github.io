## Intro

Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once theyâ€™ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.
